# Cryptanalysis Toy Project

This repository contains an implementation of AES-128 and an attack on four
round AES based on integral cryptanalysis.The attack is inspired by the attack
on the Square cipher.

The idea for this project came from David Wong's Blockbreakers project and is
in the process of being extended to a more full fledged AES-128
implementation.
